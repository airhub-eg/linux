## 1. Introduction to Linux

### 1.1 What is an Operating System?

An **operating system (OS)** is system software that:
- Manages computer hardware and software resources
- Provides common services for computer programs
- Acts as a middleman between computer hardware and users
- Provides a user interface and controls hardware so software can function

**Types of Operating Systems:**

1. **Desktop Operating Systems:**
   - Microsoft Windows
   - macOS (Apple)
   - Linux distributions (Ubuntu, etc.)

2. **Server Operating Systems:**
   - Windows Server
   - Linux distributions (CentOS, Red Hat Enterprise Linux)

3. **Mobile Operating Systems:**
   - Android
   - iOS (Apple/iPhone)
   - Windows Mobile

4. **Embedded Operating Systems:**
   - Used in routers, smart TVs, automobiles, home appliances

5. **Real-Time Operating Systems (RTOS):**
   - Critical systems: medical equipment, car ECUs, aerospace, defense, network firewalls, home security

### 1.2 What is Linux?

**Definition:** Linux is a free and open-source operating system.

**Key Characteristics:**
- **Free:** Can be downloaded, installed, and run completely free
- **Open Source:** Code is publicly available and can be modified based on application requirements
- **Popular for:** Stability, security, and flexibility
- **Distributions:** Many versions (distributions) tailored for different users

### 1.3 Why Learn Linux?

1. **Free to use**
2. **Strong command-line interface** - provides faster processing and enhanced security
3. **Open-source nature** - allows customization and community support
4. **Foundation for understanding** other operating systems

### 1.4 History of Linux

**Before Linux:**

1. **UNIX Operating System (1970):**
   - Developed at AT&T Bell Labs by Ken Thompson and Dennis Ritchie
   - Revolutionary for its time with many standard features
   - Not freely available; had various proprietary versions

2. **GNU Project (1983):**
   - Launched by Richard Stallman
   - GNU = "GNU's Not UNIX"
   - Goal: Create a free UNIX-like operating system
   - Developed many tools and utilities
   - Missing component: a complete kernel

**Birth of Linux:**

1. **Linus Torvalds (1991):**
   - 21-year-old Finnish student
   - Started developing a free OS kernel as a hobby project
   - August 25, 1991: Famous announcement: *"I am doing a free operating system. Just a hobby, won't be big and professional like GNU."*

2. **Version 0.01 (September 1991):**
   - First release of Linux kernel
   - Not functional but released publicly for viewing and comments

3. **Version 0.02 (Later 1991):**
   - Functional version
   - Combined with GNU utilities to form a complete free OS
   - This combination became known as Linux (or GNU/Linux)

**Growth and Evolution:**

- **Early 1990s:** Rapid evolution through Internet collaboration
- **1994:** Version 1.0 released with 176,000 lines of code
- **Late 1990s:** Commercial interest grew (Red Hat, SUSE provided commercial support)
- **2000:** Significant adoption in server markets; became OS of choice for embedded systems and supercomputers
- **2007:** Google released Android OS (based on Linux kernel), boosting Linux in mobile market

### 1.5 Linux Installation Options

1. Install as primary or secondary OS
2. Use virtual machine (VMware or VirtualBox)
3. Run from USB drive without installation
4. Dual boot
5. Cloud service

**Virtualization Software (VM):**
- Allows running multiple operating systems on top of main OS
- Options: VMware Player, Oracle VirtualBox
- Doesn't require losing the main host operating system

**Cloud Account:**
- Create account on AWS, Google Cloud, or similar services
- Create virtual machines with needed resources
- Install Linux OS on the virtual machine

**VirtualBox:**
- Free and open-source hypervisor for x86 computers
- Developed by Oracle Corporation
- Installs on existing Intel or AMD-based computers
- Runs on Windows, Mac, Linux, or Solaris
- Allows multiple operating systems to run simultaneously on one hardware

### 1.6 Command Line Interface (CLI)

**Overview:**
- Access all files via GUI or CLI
- CLI offers easier execution for complex tasks
- Example: Creating 1000 files - easier with CLI than GUI
- CLI widely used in scripting

**Terminal/Shell:**
Three ways to open:
1. Search Bar
2. Right-click → Choose "Open Terminal"
3. Keyboard shortcut: **Alt+Ctrl+T**
